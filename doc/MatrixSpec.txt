Specifications for Matrix.cpp
==============================

Store the matrix as a double dimensional array dynamically allocated using new. 

	The Matrix should be a public variable, since we would want to allow direct M[i][j] access to it(?)
			or
	Make it a private variable, and allow a Matrix.GetElement(i,j) access to it.

I think the first option is better.


The following functions are to be defined.
  Input, (overloaded >>)
  Output, (Pretty printing of the matrix, overloaded <<)
  overloaded matrix operators
   +, -, * 
  Invert
  Rank
  Lower Triangular Form (Row - Echelon Equivalent) (Required?)
  GetRow(i) Return the ith row as a vector(?)

  Throw selfDefined Error Class MultError if multiplication is not possible.(?)

Functions outside the class
  CheckMultCompat - Checks if two matrices M, N are compatible
 

Please add to this list if necessary.
